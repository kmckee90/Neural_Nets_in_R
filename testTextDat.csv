The
American
Civil
War
also
known
by
other
names
was
a
civil
war
in
the
United
States
from
1861
to
1865
fought
between
northern
states
loyal
to
the
Union
and
southern
states
that
had
seceded
to
form
the
Confederate
States
of
America
The
civil
war
began
as
a
result
of
the
unresolved
controversy
of
the
enslavement
of
black
people
and
its
disputed
continuance
War
broke
out
in
April
1861
when
secessionist
forces
attacked
Fort
Sumter
in
South
Carolina
just
over
a
month
after
Abraham
Lincoln
had
been
inaugurated
as
the
president
of
the
United
States
The
loyalists
of
the
Union
in
the
North
which
also
included
some
geographically
western
and
southern
states
proclaimed
support
for
the
Constitution
They
faced
secessionists
of
the
Confederate
States
in
the
South
who
advocated
for
states
rights
to
uphold
slavery
Of
the
34
US
states
in
February
1861
seven
Southern
slave
states
were
declared
by
their
state
governments
to
have
seceded
from
the
country
and
the
Confederate
States
of
America
was
organized
in
rebellion
against
the
US
constitutional
government
The
Confederacy
grew
to
control
at
least
a
majority
of
territory
in
eleven
states
and
it
claimed
the
additional
states
of
Kentucky
and
Missouri
by
assertions
from
native
secessionists
fleeing
Union
authority
These
states
were
given
full
representation
in
the
Confederate
Congress
throughout
the
Civil
War
The
two
remaining
slave
states
Delaware
and
Maryland
were
invited
to
join
the
Confederacy
but
nothing
substantial
developed
due
to
intervention
by
federal
troops
The
Confederate
states
were
never
diplomatically
recognized
as
a
joint
entity
by
the
government
of
the
United
States
nor
by
that
of
any
foreign
country
The
states
that
remained
loyal
to
the
US
were
known
as
the
Union
The
Union
and
the
Confederacy
quickly
raised
volunteer
and
conscription
armies
that
fought
mostly
in
the
South
for
four
years
Intense
combat
left
between
620000
and
750000
soldiers
dead
along
with
an
undetermined
number
of
civilians
The
Civil
War
remains
the
deadliest
military
conflict
in
American
history
and
accounted
for
more
American
military
deaths
than
all
other
wars
combined
until
the
Vietnam
War
The
war
effectively
ended
on
April
9
1865
when
Confederate
General
Robert
E
Lee
surrendered
to
Union
General
Ulysses
S
Grant
at
the
Battle
of
Appomattox
Court
House
Confederate
generals
throughout
the
Southern
states
followed
suit
the
last
surrender
on
land
occurring
June
23
Much
of
the
Souths
infrastructure
was
destroyed
especially
its
railroads
The
Confederacy
collapsed
slavery
was
abolished
and
four
million
enslaved
Black
people
were
freed
The
war-torn
nation
then
entered
the
Reconstruction
era
in
a
partially
successful
attempt
to
rebuild
the
country
and
grant
civil
rights
to
freed
slaves
The
Civil
War
is
one
of
the
most
studied
and
written
about
episodes
in
US
history
and
remains
the
subject
of
cultural
and
historiographical
debate
Of
particular
interest
are
the
causes
of
the
Civil
War
and
the
persisting
myth
of
the
Lost
Cause
of
the
Confederacy
The
American
Civil
War
was
among
the
earliest
industrial
wars
Railroads
the
telegraph
steamships
and
iron-clad
ships
and
mass-produced
weapons
were
employed
extensively
The
mobilization
of
civilian
factories
mines
shipyards
banks
transportation
and
food
supplies
all
foreshadowed
the
impact
of
industrialization
in
World
War
I
World
War
II
and
subsequent
conflicts
he
election
of
Lincoln
provoked
the
legislature
of
South
Carolina
to
call
a
state
convention
to
consider
secession
Before
the
war
South
Carolina
did
more
than
any
other
Southern
state
to
advance
the
notion
that
a
state
had
the
right
to
nullify
federal
laws
and
even
to
secede
from
the
United
States
The
convention
unanimously
voted
to
secede
on
December
20
1860
and
adopted
the
Declaration
of
the
Immediate
Causes
Which
Induce
and
Justify
the
Secession
of
South
Carolina
from
the
Federal
Union
It
argued
for
states
rights
for
slave
owners
in
the
South
but
contained
a
complaint
about
states
rights
in
the
North
in
the
form
of
opposition
to
the
Fugitive
Slave
Act
claiming
that
Northern
states
were
not
fulfilling
their
federal
obligations
under
the
Constitution
The

of
Mississippi
Florida
Alabama
Georgia
Louisiana
and
Texas

and

1860
Among
the
ordinances
of
secession
passed
by
the
individual
states
those
of
three—Texas
Alabama
and
Virginia
specifically
mentioned
the
plight
of
the
slaveholding
states
at
the
hands
of
Northern
abolitionists
The
rest
make
no
mention
of
the
slavery
issue
and
are
often
brief
announcements
of
the
dissolution
of
ties
by
the
legislatures
However
at
least
four
states—South
Carolina
Mississippi
Georgia
and
Texas
also
passed
lengthy
and
detailed
explanations
of
their
causes
for
secession
all
of
which
laid
the
blame
squarely
on
the
movement
to
abolish
slavery
and
that
movements
influence
over
the
politics
of
the
Northern
states
The
Southern
states
believed
slaveholding
was
a
constitutional
right
because
of
the
Fugitive
Slave
Clause
of
the
Constitution
These
states
agreed
to
form
a
new
federal
government
the
Confederate
States
of
America
on
February
4
1861
They
took
control
of
federal
forts
and
other
properties
within
their
boundaries
with
little
resistance
from
outgoing
President
James
Buchanan
whose
term
ended
on
March
4
1861
Buchanan
said
that
the
Dred
Scott
decision
was
proof
that
the
South
had
no
reason
for
secession
and
that
the
Union
was
intended
to
be
perpetual
but
that
The
power
by
force
of
arms
to
compel
a
State
to
remain
in
the
Union
was
not
among
the
enumerated
powers
granted
to
Congress
One-quarter
of
the
US
Army
the
entire
garrison
in
Texas—was
surrendered
in
February
1861
to
state
forces
by
its
commanding
general
David
E
Twiggs
who
then
joined
the
Confederacy
As
Southerners
resigned
their
seats
in
the
Senate
and
the
House
Republicans
were
able
to
pass
projects
that
had
been
blocked
by
Southern
senators
before
the
war
These
included
the
Morrill
Tariff
land
grant
colleges
the
Morrill
Act
a
Homestead
Act
a
transcontinental

the
Pacific

the

in
the
District
of
Columbia
The
Revenue
Act
of
1861
introduced
the
income
tax
to
help
finance
the
war
On
December
18
1860
the
Crittenden
Compromise
was
proposed
to
re-establish
the
Missouri
Compromise
line
by
constitutionally
banning
slavery
in
territories
to
the
north
of
the
line
while
guaranteeing
it
to
the
south
The
adoption
of
this
compromise
likely
would
have
prevented
the
secession
of
every
Southern
state
apart
from
South
Carolina
but
Lincoln
and
the
Republicans
rejected
it
It
was
then
proposed
to
hold
a
national
referendum
on
the
compromise
The
Republicans
again
rejected
the
idea
although
a
majority
of
both
Northerners
and
Southerners
would
likely
have
voted
in
favor
of
it
A
pre-war
February
Peace
Conference
of
1861
met
in
Washington
proposing
a
solution
similar
to
that
of
the
Crittenden
compromise;
it
was
rejected
by
Congress
The
Republicans
proposed
an
alternative
compromise
to
not
interfere
with
slavery
where
it
existed
but
the
South
regarded
it
as
insufficient
Nonetheless
the
remaining
eight
slave
states
rejected
pleas
to
join
the
Confederacy
following
a
two-to-one
no-vote
in
Virginias

Convention

of

of
America
1861
On
March
4
1861
Abraham
Lincoln
was
sworn
in
as
president
In
his
inaugural
address
he
argued
that
the
Constitution
was
a
more
perfect
union
than
the
earlier
Articles
of
Confederation
and
Perpetual
Union
that
it
was
a
binding
contract
and
called
any
secession
legally
void
He
had
no
intent
to
invade
Southern
states
nor
did
he
intend
to
end
slavery
where
it
existed
but
said
that
he
would
use
force
to
maintain
possession
of
Federal
property
The
government
would
make
no
move
to
recover
post
offices
and
if
resisted
mail
delivery
would
end
at
state
lines
Where
popular
conditions
did
not
allow
peaceful
enforcement
of
Federal
law
US
marshals
and
judges
would
be
withdrawn
No
mention
was
made
of
bullion
lost
from
US
mints
in
Louisiana
Georgia
and
North
Carolina
He
stated
that
it
would
be
US
policy
to
only
collect
import
duties
at
its
ports;
there
could
be
no
serious
injury
to
the
South
to
justify
the
armed
revolution
during
his
administration
His
speech
closed
with
a
plea
for
restoration
of
the
bonds
of
union
famously
calling
on
the
mystic
chords
of
memory
binding
the
two
regions
The
South
sent
delegations
to
Washington
and
offered
to
pay
for
the
federal
properties
and
enter
into
a
peace
treaty
with
the
United
States
Lincoln
rejected
any
negotiations
with
Confederate
agents
because
he
claimed
the
Confederacy
was
not
a
legitimate
government
and
that
making
any
treaty
with
it
would
be
tantamount
to
recognition
of
it
as
a
sovereign
government
